3. Run the entry script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

```python
cart.add_item(cheese, 2)
cart.add_item(tv, 1)
cart.add_item(scratch_card, 1)
cart.add_item(biscuits, 1)
checkout(customer, cart)

##  Edge Cases Handled

* âœ… Expired products are not added to the cart
* âœ… Cannot add more than available quantity
* âœ… Checkout fails if cart is empty
* âœ… Checkout fails if customer balance is insufficient
* âœ… Shipping fee only applies to shippable items

---

##  Notes

* Follows clean **Object-Oriented Design** practices
* Uses **duck typing** for shippable items (`get_name()` and `get_weight()`)
* Console output format fully matches challenge requirements
